COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Saving/Loading
Name: Chloe Barnes
Date: 10/31/2025

AI Usage: [Document any AI assistance used] 
I used AI (ChatGPT) to help write lines 106 and 107. These lines determine the directory from a file path and then check if that directory exists on the file system.
I used AI (Gemini) to generate character backstories.
i used AI (Gemini) to help me create clear variable names.

first issue: no virtual env:
    (cmd + shift + p)
    python create environment
    select recommended if there is one else pick the global one
    activate venv: path/to/activate/executable
